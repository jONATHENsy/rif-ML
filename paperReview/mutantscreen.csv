For this purpose, we carried out four adaptive laboratory evolutions (ALE) in parallel of Salmonella enterica Typhimurium with carvacrol. After 10 evolution steps, we selected and characterized one colony from each lineage (SeCarA, SeCarB, SeCarC, and SeCarD). Phenotypic characterization of the four evolved strains revealed enhanced survival to lethal treatments; two of them (SeCarA and SeCarB) showed an increase of minimum inhibitory concentration of carvacrol and a better growth fitness in the presence of carvacrol compared to wild-type strain. Whole genome sequencing revealed 10 mutations, of which four (rrsH, sseG, wbaV, and flhA) were present in more than one strain, whereas six (nirC, fliH, lon, rob, upstream yfhP, and upstream argR) were unique to individual strains. Single-mutation genetic constructs in SeWT confirmed lon and rob as responsible for the increased resistance to carvacrol as well as to antibiotics (ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, nalidixic acid, rifampicin, tetracycline, and trimethoprim). wbaV played an important role in increased tolerance against carvacrol and chloramphenicol, and flhA in cross-tolerance to heat treatments.

"Patel, Y; Soni, V; Rhee, KY; Helmann, JD",Mutations in rpoB That Confer Rifampicin Resistance Can Alter Levels of Peptidoglycan Precursors and Affect ???????2-Lactam Susceptibility,MBIO,"Bacteria can adapt to stressful conditions through mutations affecting the RNA polymerase core subunits that lead to beneficial changes in transcription. In response to selection with rifampicin (RIF), mutations arise in the RIF resistance-deter-mining region (RRDR) of rpoB that reduce antibiotic binding. These changes can also alter transcription and thereby have pleiotropic effects on bacterial fitness. Here, we studied the evolution of resistance in Bacillus subtilis to the synergistic combination of RIF and the /3-lactam cefuroxime (CEF). Two independent evolution experiments led to the recovery of a single rpoB allele (S487L) that was able to confer resistance to RIF and CEF through a single mutation. Two other common RRDR mutations made the cells 32 times more sensitive to CEF (H482Y) or led to only modest CEF resistance (Q469R). The diverse effects of these three mutations on CEF resistance are correlated with differences in the expression of peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis genes and in the levels of two metabolites crucial in regulating PG synthesis, glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN-6-P) and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc).

Streptococci lack a canonical SOS response, but an SOS-like response was reported in some species. The mef(A)-msr(D)-carrying prophage.1207.3 of Streptococcus pyogenes contains a region, spanning orf6 to orf11, showing homology to characterized streptococcal SOS-like cassettes. Genome-wide homology search showed the presence of the whole F1207.3 SOS-like cassette in three S. pyogenes prophages, while parts of it were found in other bacterial species. To investigate whether this cassette confers an SOS-mutagenesis phenotype, we constructed Streptococcus pneumoniae R6 isogenic derivative strains: (i) FR172, streptomycin resistant, (ii) FR173, carrying F1207.3, and (iii) FR174, carrying a recombinant F1207.3, where the SOS-like cassette was deleted. These strains were used in survival and mutation rate assays using a UV- C LED instrument, for which we designed and 3D-printed a customized equipment, constituted of an instrument support and swappable-autoclavable mini-plates and lids.

The presence of F1207.3 SOS-like cassette resulted in a significantsignificantsignificantincrease in the mutation rate (up to 18-fold) at every wavelength. In conclusion, we demonstrated that F1207.3 carries a functional SOS-like cassette responsible for an increased survival and increased mutation rate in S. pneumoniae.

The SOS response is a DNA repair mechanism activated by some bacteria in response to stressful conditions, which leads to a temporary hypermutable phenotype and is usually absent in streptococcal genomes. Here, using a reproducible and controlled UV irradiation system, we demonstrated that the SOS-like gene cassette of prophage F1207.3 is functional, responsible for a temporary hypermutable phenotype, and enhances bacterial survival to UV irradiation.

"Leehan, JD; Nicholson, WL",The Spectrum of Spontaneous Rifampin Resistance Mutations in the Bacillus subtilis rpoB Gene Depends on the Growth Environment,APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,"Results from previous investigations into spontaneous rifampin resistance (Rif(r)) mutations in the Bacillus subtilis rpoB gene suggested that the spectrum of mutations depends on the growth environment. However, these studies were limited by low sample numbers, allowing for the potential distortion of the data by the presence of jackpot mutations that may have arisen early in the growth of a population. Here, we addressed this issue by performing fluctuation analyses to assess both the rate and spectrum of Rif(r) mutations in two distinct media: LB, a complete laboratory medium, and SMMAsn, a minimal medium utilizing L-asparagine as the sole carbon source. We cultivated 60 separate populations under each growth condition and determined the mutation rate to Rif(r) to be slightly but significantly higher in LB cultures. We then sequenced the relevant regions of rpoB to map the spectrum of Rif(r) mutations under each growth condition. We found a distinct spectrum of mutations in each medium; LB cultures were dominated by the H482Y mutation (27/53 or 51%), whereas SMMAsn cultures were dominated by the S487L mutation (24/51 or 47%). Furthermore, we found through competition experiments that the relative fitness of the S487L mutant was significantly higher in SMMAsn than in LB medium. We therefore conclude that both the spectrum of Rif(r) mutations in the B. subtilis rpoB gene and the fitness of resulting mutants are influenced by the growth environment. IMPORTANCE The rpoB gene encodes the beta subunit of RNA polymerase, and mutations in rpoB are key determinants of resistance to the clinically important antibiotic rifampin.

Here, we demonstrate that the pathogen Bartonella can undergo stress-induced mutagenesis despite the fact it lacks error-prone polymerases, the rpoS gene and functional UV-induced mutagenesis. We demonstrate that Bartonella acquire de novo single mutations during rifampicin exposure at suprainhibitory concentrations at a much higher rate than expected from spontaneous fluctuations. This is while exhibiting a minimal heteroresistance capacity. The emerged resistant mutants acquired a single rpoB mutation, whereas no other mutations were found in their whole genome. Interestingly, the emergence of resistance in Bartonella occurred only during gradual exposure to the antibiotic, indicating that Bartonella sense and react to the changing environment. Using a mathematical model, we demonstrated that, to reproduce the experimental results, mutation rates should be transiently increased over 1,000-folds, and a larger population size or greater heteroresistance capacity is required.

"Liu, LP; Ingmer, H; Vestergaard, M",Genome-Wide Identification of Resveratrol Intrinsic Resistance Determinants in Staphylococcus aureus,ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL,"Resveratrol has been extensively studied due to its potential health benefits in multiple diseases, for example, cancer, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. Besides these properties, resveratrol displays inhibitory activity against a wide range of bacterial species; however, the cellular effects of resveratrol in bacteria remain incompletely understood, especially in the human pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. In this study, we aimed to identify intrinsic resistance genes that aid S. aureus in tolerating the activity of resveratrol. We screened the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library, consisting of 1920 mutants with inactivation of non-essential genes in S. aureus JE2, for increased susceptibly to resveratrol. On agar plates containing 0.5x the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), 17 transposon mutants failed to grow. Of these, four mutants showed a two-fold reduction in MIC, being the clpP protease mutant and three mutants with deficiencies in the electron transport chain (menD, hemB, aroC). The remaining 13 mutants did not show a reduction in MIC, but were confirmed by spot-assays to have increased susceptibility to resveratrol. Several genes were associated with DNA damage repair (recJ, xerC and xseA). Treatment of S. aureus JE2 with sub-inhibitory concentrations of resveratrol did not affect the expression of recJ, xerC and xseA, but increased expression of the SOS-stress response genes lexA and recA, suggesting that resveratrol interferes with DNA integrity in S. aureus.

Rifampicin resistance is common in several microorganisms and it is typically caused by point mutations in the gene encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase, rpoB. Different rpoB mutations are responsible for various levels of rifampicin resistance and for a range of secondary effects. rpoB mutations conferring rifampicin resistance have been shown to be responsible for severe effects on transcription, cell fitness, bacterial stress response and virulence. Such effects have never been investigated in the marine pathogen Vibrio vulnificus, even though rifampicinresistant strains of V. vulnificus have been isolated previously. Moreover, spontaneous rifampicinresistant strains of V. vulnificus have an important role in conjugation and mutagenesis protocols, with poor consideration of the effects of rpoB mutations. In this work, effects on growth, stress response and virulence of V. vulnificus were investigated using a set of nine spontaneous rifampicinresistant derivatives of V. vulnificus CMCP6. Three different mutations (Q513K, S522L and H526Y) were identified with varying incidence rates. These three mutant types each showed high resistance to rifampicin [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) >800 mu g ml(-1)], but different secondary effects. The strains carrying the mutation H526Y had a growth advantage in rich medium but had severely reduced salt stress tolerance in the presence of high NaCl concentrations as well as a significant reduction in ethanol stress resistance. Strains possessing the S522L mutation had reduced growth rate and overall biomass accumulation in rich medium. Furthermore, investigation of virulence characteristics demonstrated that all the rifampicinresistant strains showed compromised motility when compared with the wild type, but no major effects on exoenzyme production were observed.

Here we present a compelling example in a veterinary pathogen, Rhodococcus equi, the causative agent of a severe pulmonary infection affecting foals worldwide. We show that the erm(46) gene responsible for emerging macrolide resistance among equine R. equi isolates in the United States is part of a 6.9-kb transposable element, TnRErm46, actively mobilized by an IS481 family transposase. TnRErm46 is carried on an 87-kb conjugative plasmid, pRErm46, transferable between R. equi strains at frequencies up to 10(-3). The erm(46) gene becomes stabilized in R. equi by pRErm46's apparent fitness neutrality and wholesale TnRErm46 transposition onto the host genome.

The survival and pathogenic potential of S. aureus depend partly on its ability to sense and respond to changes in its environment. Spx is a thiol/oxidative stress sensor that interacts with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase RpoA subunit, leading to changes in gene expression that help sustain viability under various conditions. Using genetic and deep-sequencing methods, we show that spx is essential in S. aureus and that a previously reported Delta spx strain harbored suppressor mutations that allowed it to grow without spx. One of these mutations is a single missense mutation in rpoB (a P-to-L change at position 519 encoded by rpoB [rpoB-P519L]) that conferred high-level resistance to rifampin. This mutation alone was found to be sufficient to bypass the requirement for spx. The generation of rifampin resistance libraries led to the discovery of an additional rpoB mutation, R484H, which supported strains with the spx disruption.

Here, we expressed bacterial haemoglobin (Vhb) in Strep.zooepidemicus. Due to highly efficient oxygen use, only 1526gl(-1) lactic acid was produced, which is 073 times the quantity produced by the control strain. Compared with the control strain (161gl(-1)), hyaluronic acid (HA) production in this strain did not substantially increase, only to 216gl(-1). Next, we used a series of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitroso-guanidine (NTG) treatments and selection programmes. Finally, we generated a hyaluronidase-negative and rifampin-resistant mutant strain that produces high levels of HA. The optimum carbon concentration for maximum hyaluronic acid production is only 30gl(-1) of sucrose, which is lower than the control strain (60gl(-1)). The oxygen transfer rate coefficient K(L)a increased significantly to 37253h(-1) from 18 +/- 4h(-1) of the control. The optimum carbon source for this strain is 21gl(-1) of sucrose, 9gl(-1) of maltose and 5gl(-1) of glutamic acid. Hyaluronic acid accumulated at 67gl(-1) in the culture broth. However, the molecular weight of HA decreased from 1835KDa (Control) to 429kDa. The prepared low-molecular weight HA could function as potential antiangiogenic substances, antiviral and antitumour agents to possibly be used as functional food ingredients. Significance and Impact of the StudyHyaluronic acid (HA) has been used for a wide range of applications in health, cosmetic and clinical fields.

We report on the rapid positive selection of a novel vaccinia virus genomic duplication mutant in the presence of the assembly inhibitor rifampin. Until now, all known rifampin-resistant vaccinia virus isolates have contained missense mutations in the D13L gene, which encodes a capsid-like scaffold protein required for stabilizing membrane curvature during the early stage of virion assembly. Here we describe a second pathway to rifampin resistance involving A17, a membrane protein that binds and anchors D13 to the immature virion. After one round of selection, a rifampin-resistant virus that contained a genomic duplication in the A17L-A21L region was recovered. The mutant had both C-terminally truncated and full-length A17L open reading frames. Expression of the truncated A17 protein was retained when the virus was passaged in the presence of rifampin but was lost in the absence of the drug, suggesting that the duplication decreased general fitness. Both forms of A17 were bound to the virion membrane and associated with D13. Moreover, insertion of an additional truncated or inducible full-length A17L open reading frame into the genome of the wild-type virus was sufficient to confer rifampin resistance. In summary, this report contains the first evidence of an alternate mechanism for resistance of poxviruses to rifampin, indicates a direct relationship between A17 levels and the resistance phenotype, and provides further evidence of the ability of double-stranded DNA viruses to acquire drug resistance through gene duplication. IMPORTANCE The present study provides the first evidence of a new mechanism of resistance of a poxvirus to the antiviral drug rifampin. In addition, it affirms the importance of the interaction between the D13 scaffold protein and the A17 membrane protein for assembly of virus particles. Resistance to rifampin was linked to a partial duplication of the gene encoding the A17 protein, similar to the resistance to hydroxyurea enabled by duplication of the gene encoding the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase and of the K3L gene to allow adaptation to the antiviral action of protein kinase R.

Previous studies have shown that exposure of Bacillus subtilis spores to ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) characteristic of space both increased the spontaneous mutation rate and altered the spectrum of mutation in various marker genes; but, to date, mutagenesis studies have not been performed on spores exposed to milder low pressures encountered in the martian environment. Mutations to rifampicin-resistance (Rif(R)) were isolated in B. subtilis spores exposed to simulated martian atmosphere (99.9% CO2, 710 Pa) for 21 days in a Mars Simulation Chamber (MSC) and compared to parallel Earth controls. Exposure in the MSC reduced spore viability by similar to 67% compared to Earth controls, but this decrease was not statistically significant (P = 0.3321). The frequency of mutation to Rif(R) was also not significantly increased in the MSC compared to Earth-exposed spores (P = 0.479). Forty-two and 51 Rif(R) mutant spores were isolated from the MSC- and Earth-exposed controls, respectively. Nucleotide sequencing located the Rif(R) mutations in the rpoB gene encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase at residue V135F of the N-cluster and at residues Q469K/L, H482D/P/R/Y, and S487L in Cluster I. No mutations were found in rpoB Clusters II or III. Two new alleles, Q469L and H482D, previously unreported in B. subtilis rpoB, were isolated from spores exposed in the MSC; otherwise, only slight differences were observed in the spectra of spontaneous Rif(R) mutations from spores exposed to Earth vs. the MSC.

SCVs reverted to SMV, but no reversion to the wild-type phenotype was noted, indicating that these variants were distinct from opaque-and transparent-phase variants.

"Eutsey, R; Wang, G; Maier, RJ",Role of a MutY DNA glycosylase in combating oxidative DNA damage in Helicobacter pylori,DNA REPAIR,"Mutt is an adenine glycosylase that has the ability to efficiently remove adenines from adenine/7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-G) or adenine/guanine mismatches, and plays an important role in oxidative DNA damage repair. The human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori has a homolog of the Mutt enzyme. To investigate the physiological roles of MutY in H. pylori, we constructed and characterized a muff mutant. H. pylori muff mutants incubated at 5% O-2 have a 325-fold higher spontaneous mutation rate than its parent. The mutation rate is further increased by exposing the mutant to atmospheric levels of oxygen, an effect that is not seen in an E. coli muff mutant. Most of the mutations that occurred in H. pylori muff mutants, as examined by rpoB sequence changes that confer rifampicin resistance, are GC to TA transversions. The H. pylori enzyme has the ability to complement an E. coli muff mutant, restoring its mutation frequency to the wild-type level. Pure H. pylori MutY has the ability to remove adenines from A/8-oxo-G mismatches, but strikingly no ability to cleave A/G mismatches. This is surprising because E. coli MutY can more rapidly turnover A/G than A/8-oxo-G. Thus, H. pylori Mutt is an adenine glycosylase involved in the repair of oxidative DNA damage with a specificity for detecting 8-oxo-G.

We supposed that spontaneous antibiotic resistance mutation could cause this phenotypic change. To model our hypothesis we isolated rifampicin- (Rif) and ampicillin- (Amp) resistant mutants from E. coli O157:117 prototype strains 7785 and EDL933. Among Rif(r) mutants we could isolate strains with no or reduced motility, while the Amp(r) mutants became hypermotile. The biochemical profile of the mutants had not changed but phage sensitivity and generation time of the mutants were altered. Among the representative strains we did not find polymorphism with Southern blot analysis and no polymorphism. was found in the fliC gene of the mutants. The described characteristics have proven to be stable. In a mice virulence assay by intravenous infections the virulence of the derivatives was also found to be changed.

So far, the molecular mechanism of the emergence of SCVs is not understood and regulatory as well as genetic mechanisms seem conceivable. To screen for possible mutations, the hemin biosynthetic gene cluster of a gentamicin-induced SCV was sequenced and was found to contain a deletion in the gene hemH. To further assess the influence of a high mutation rate on the development of SCVs, we tested the emergence of SCVs in a strain that had been inactivated in the DNA proofreading enzyme MutS. In the mutant, spontaneous SCVs emerged 556-fold more frequently than in the parent strain. By incubation in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin, the SCV frequency in the parent strain could be increased to 9.7 x 10(-6), whereas it remained rather stable in the mutant (1.8 x 10(-5)).

"Olczak, AA; Olson, JW; Maier, RJ",Oxidative-stress resistance mutants of Helicobacter pylori,JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY,"Within a large family of peroxidases, one member that catalyzes the reduction of organic peroxides to alcohols is known as alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, or AhpC. Gene disruption mutations in the gene encoding AhpC of Helicobacter pylori (ahpC) were generated by screening transformants under low-oxygen conditions. Two classes of mutants were obtained. Both types lack AhpC protein, but the major class (type I) isolated was found to synthesize increased levels (five times more than the wild type) of another proposed antioxidant protein, an iron-binding, neutrophil-activating protein (NapA). The other class of mutants, the minor class (type II), produced wild-type levels of NapA. The two types of AhpC mutants differed in their frequencies of spontaneous mutation to rifampin resistance and in their sensitivities to oxidative-stress chemicals, with the type I mutants exhibiting less sensitivity to organic hydroperoxides as well as having a lower mutation frequency. The napA promoter regions of the two types of AhpC mutants were identical, and primer extension analysis revealed their transcription start site to be the same as for the wild type. Gene disruption mutations were obtained in napA alone, and a double mutant strain (ahpC napA) was also created. All four of the oxidative-stress resistance mutants could be distinguished from the wild type in oxygen sensitivity or in some other oxidative-stress resistance phenotype (i.e., in sensitivity to stress-related chemicals and spontaneous mutation frequency). For example, growth of the NapA mutant was more sensitive to oxygen than that of the wild-type strain and both of the AhpC-type mutants were highly sensitive to paraquat and to cumene hydroperoxide. Of the four types of mutants, the double mutant was the most sensitive to growth inhibition by oxygen and by organic peroxides and it had the highest spontaneous mutation frequency. Notably, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined with protein sequence analysis identified another possible oxidative-stress resistance protein (HP0630) that was up-regulated in the double mutant.

Both activities are mediated by a single base change within the anticodon such that the mutant tRNA can decode aspartate codons (GAC/U) instead of the normal glycine codons (GCC/U). Here, we investigate whether specific Asp--> Gly mistranslation is required for the unexpected mutator phenotype. To address this question, we created and expressed 18 individual alleles of alaV , the gene encoding an alanine tRNA, in which the alanine anticodon was replaced with those specifying other amino acids such that the mutant (alaV(X) ) tRNAs are expected to potentiate X--> Ala mistranslation, where X is one of the other amino acids. Almost all alaV(X) alleles proved to be mutators in an assay that measured the frequency of rifampicin-resistant mutants, with one allele (alaV(Glu) ) being a stronger mutator than mutA . The alaV(Glu) mutator phenotype resembles that of mutA in mutational specificity (predominantly transversions), as well as SOS independence, but in a puzzling twist differs from mutA in that it does not require a functional recA gene. Our results suggest that general mistranslation (as opposed to Asp--> Gly alone) can induce a mutator phenotype. Furthermore, these findings predict that a large number of conditions that increase translational errors, such as genetic defects in the translational apparatus, as well as environmental and physiological stimuli (such as amino acid starvation or exposure to antibiotics) are likely to activate a mutator response.

Mutants with enhanced (1.6- to 3-fold-higher) actinorhodin production were detected at a high frequency (5 to 10%) among isolates resistant to streptomycin (Str(r)), gentamicin (Gen(r)), or rifampin (Rif), which developed spontaneously on agar plates which contained one of the three drugs. Construction of double mutants (str gen and str rif) by introducing gentamicin or rifampin resistance into an str mutant resulted in further increased (1.7- to 2.5-fold-higher) actinorhodin productivity. Likewise, triple mutants (str gen rif) thus constructed were found to have an even greater ability for producing the antibiotic, eventually generating a mutant able to produce 48 times more actinorhodin than the wild-type strain. Analysis of str mutants revealed that a point mutation occurred within the rpsL gene, which encodes the ribosomal protein S12. rif mutants were found to have a point mutation in the rpoB gene, which encodes the beta -subunit of RNA polymerase. Mutation points in gen mutants still remain unknown.

"Seyler, RW; Olson, JW; Maier, RJ",Superoxide dismutase-deficient mutants of Helicobacter pylori are hypersensitive to oxidative stress and defective in host colonization,INFECTION AND IMMUNITY,"Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a nearly ubiquitous enzyme among organisms that are exposed to oxic environments. The single SOD of Helicobacter pylori, encoded by the sodB gene, has been suspected to be a virulence factor for this pathogenic microaerophile, but mutations in this gene have not been reported previously. We have isolated mutants with interruptions in the sodB gene and have characterized them with respect to their response to oxidative stress and ability to colonize the mouse stomach. The sodB mutants are devoid of SOD activity, based on activity staining in nondenaturing gels and quantitative assays of cell extracts. Though wild-type H. pylori is microaerophilic, the mutants are even more sensitive to O-2 for both growth and viability. While the mild-type strain is routinely grown at 12% O-2, growth of the mutant strains is severely inhibited at above 5 to 6% O-2, the effect of O-2 on viability was determined by subjecting nongrowing cells to atmospheric levels of O-2 and plating for survivors at 2-h time intervals. Wild-type cell viability dropped by about 1 order of magnitude after 6 h, while viability of the sodB mutant decreased by more than 6 orders of magnitude at the same time point. The mutants are also more sensitive to H2O2, and this sensitivity is exacerbated by increased O-2 concentrations. Since oxidative stress has been correlated with DNA damage, the frequency of spontaneous mutation to rifampin resistance was studied. The frequency of mutagenesis of an sodB mutant strain is about 15-fold greater than that of the wild-type strain. In the mouse colonization model, only 1 out of 23 mice inoculated with an SOD-deficient mutant of a mouse-adapted strain became H. pylori positive, while 15 out of 17 mice inoculated with the wild-type strain were shown to harbor the organism. Therefore, SOD is a virulence factor which affects the ability of this organism to colonize the mouse stomach and is important for the growth and survival of H. pylori under conditions of oxidative stress.",2001,,10.1128/IAI.69.6.4034-4040.2001,WOS:000168784300065,10.1128/IAI.69.6.4034-4040.2001||WOS:000168784300065,"superoxide dismutase-deficient mutants of helicobacter pylori are hypersensitive to oxidative stress and defective in host colonization superoxide dismutase (sod) is a nearly ubiquitous enzyme among organisms that are exposed to oxic environments. the single sod of helicobacter pylori, encoded by the sodb gene, has been suspected to be a virulence factor for this pathogenic microaerophile, but mutations in this gene have not been reported previously. we have isolated mutants with interruptions in the sodb gene and have characterized them with respect to their response to oxidative stress and ability to colonize the mouse stomach. the sodb mutants are devoid of sod activity, based on activity staining in nondenaturing gels and quantitative assays of cell extracts. though wild-type h. pylori is microaerophilic, the mutants are even more sensitive to o-2 for both growth and viability. while the mild-type strain is routinely grown at 12% o-2, growth of the mutant strains is severely inhibited at above 5 to 6% o-2, the effect of o-2 on viability was determined by subjecting nongrowing cells to atmospheric levels of o-2 and plating for survivors at 2-h time intervals. wild-type cell viability dropped by about 1 order of magnitude after 6 h, while viability of the sodb mutant decreased by more than 6 orders of magnitude at the same time point. the mutants are also more sensitive to h2o2, and this sensitivity is exacerbated by increased o-2 concentrations. since oxidative stress has been correlated with dna damage, the frequency of spontaneous mutation to rifampin resistance was studied. the frequency of mutagenesis of an sodb mutant strain is about 15-fold greater than that of the wild-type strain. in the mouse colonization model, only 1 out of 23 mice inoculated with an sod-deficient mutant of a mouse-adapted strain became h. pylori positive, while 15 out of 17 mice inoculated with the wild-type strain were shown to harbor the organism. therefore, sod is a virulence factor which affects the ability of this organism to colonize the mouse stomach and is important for the growth and survival of h. pylori under conditions of oxidative stress.",0.69911593,1,10.1128/IAI.69.6.4034-4040.2001||WOS:000168784300065,,,,,,,FALSE,,Old paper

Although MutY K142Q does not form a Schiff base with DNA, it retains in part the catalytic properties of wild-type enzyme. The K142Q mutation selectively impairs processing of DNA containing dA:dG mispairs but not that of substrates containing dA:8-oxodG, Decreased substrate processing is mediated primarily via an increase in K-D (21.8 nM for MutY vs 298 nM for MutY K142Q). The catalytic constant, measured in single turnover experiments, was not significantly affected. At pH < 6.0, the activity of MutY K142Q on the dA:dG mispair was approximately the same as for wild-type protein, suggesting that a dc(anti) to dG(syn) transition is effected at low pH.

"KREUZER, KN; ENGMAN, HW; YAP, WY",TERTIARY INITIATION OF REPLICATION IN BACTERIOPHAGE-T4 - DELETION OF THE OVERLAPPING UVSY PROMOTER REPLICATION ORIGIN FROM THE PHAGE GENOME,JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY,"Tertiary initiation of bacteriophage T4 DNA replication is resistant to the RNA polymerase inhibitor rifampicin and apparently involved in the activity of recombination hot spots in the t4 genome (Kreuzer, K. N., and Alberts, B. M. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 3345-3349). One of the origins that function by the tertiary mechanism maps at the promoter for gene uvsY. A deletion and a linker-insertion mutation in the uvsY promoter/origin region were generated by in vitro manipulations and then placed into the T4 genome using the insertion/substitution system (Selick, H. E., Kreuzer, K. N., and Alberts, B. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11336-11347). Both resulting phage strains are uvsY- mutants, but they differ in that one has a deletion of the minimal tertiary origin and the other does not. The effects of the uvsY mutations on tertiary origin activity were assayed by infecting tertiary origin plasmid-bearing Escherichia coli with the two phage mutants. The tertiary origin plasmids replicated extensively after infection by either uvsY- phage mutant, demonstrating that the uvsY protein is not required for tertiary initiation. The extent of plasmid replication was increased dramatically as a result of either mutation, indicating that the uvsY protein plays some negative role in either the initiation or subsequent processing of plasmid replicative intermediates.

,RNA-POLYMERASE (RPOB) MUTANTS SELECTED FOR INCREASED RESISTANCE TO GYRASE INHIBITORS IN SALMONELLA-TYPHIMURIUM,MOLECULAR AND GENERAL GENETICS,"Some rifampicin-resistance (Rif(R)) mutations make bacteria slightly resistant to the gyrase inhibitors novobiocin (Nov) and nalidixic acid (Nal). This suggested that it might be possible to isolate rpoB mutants using either drug for positive selection. In an inital test, we confirmed the presence of Rif-resistant isolates among clones selected for Nov resistance. These mutants are also more resistant to Nal. In a subsequent experiment, we found that mutants selected for low-level resistance to Nal include isolates harboring mutations genetically linked to the rpoB locus; of two such mutants studied, one is temperature-sensitive for growth. These two mutants, which are only marginally affected in their response to Nov, are normally sensitive to Rif and thus might be representative of a new class of rpoB alleles. The Rif-resistant and Rif-sensitive rpoB alleles that increase resistance to gyrase inhibitors have one property in common: they all suppress, to varying degrees, the defect in his operon regulation (transcriptional deattenuation) caused by a gyrase defect or inhibition by novobiocin. To further analyse the transcription-supercoiling relationships in these mutants, we examined the ability of RNA polymerase to recruit gyrase activity during transcription. This was done by two independent approaches: (i) observing transcription-induced accumulation of hyper-negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA in a topA mutant background and (ii) measuring transcription-induced plasmid DNA cleavage in the presence of oxolinic acid. Results indicate that the rpoB alleles described in this study diminish the recruitment of gyrase activity by the transcription process.

,Molecular characterization of Rifr mutations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida,MUTATION RESEARCH-FUNDAMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF MUTAGENESIS,"The rpoB gene encoding for beta subunit of RNA polymerase is a target of mutations leading to rifampicin resistant (Rif(r)) phenotype of bacteria. Here we have characterized rpoB/Rif(r) system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida as a test system for studying mutational processes. We found that in addition to the appearance of large colonies which were clearly visible on Rif selective plates already after 24 h of plating, small colonies grew up on these plates for 48 h. The time-dependent appearance of the mutant colonies onto selective plates was caused by different levels of Rif resistance of the mutants. The Rif(r) clusters of the rpoB gene were sequenced and analyzed for 360 mutants of P. aeruginosa and for 167 mutants of P. putida. The spectrum of Rif(r) mutations characterized for P. aeruginosa grown at 37 degrees C and that characterized for P. putida grown at 30 degrees C were dissimilar but the differences almost disappeared when the mutants of both strain were isolated at the same temperature, at 30 degrees C. The strong Rif(r) phenotype of P. aeruginosa and A putida was accompanied only with substitutions of these residues which belong to the putative Rif-binding pocket. Approximately 70% of A aeruginosa mutants, which were isolated at 37 degrees C and expressed weak Rif(r) phenotype, contained base substitutions in the N-terminal cluster of the rpoB gene. The differences in the spectra of mutations at 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C can be explained by temperature-sensitive growth of several mutants in the presence of rifampicin. Thus, our results imply that both the temperature for the growth of bacteria and the time for isolation of Rif(r) mutants from selective plates are critical when the rpoB/Rif(r) test system is employed for comparative studies of mutagenic processes in Pseudomonas species which are conventionally cultivated at different temperatures.

,Expanded Genetic Codes Create New Mutational Routes to Rifampicin Resistance in Escherichia coli,MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,"Until recently, evolutionary questions surrounding the nature of the genetic code have been mostly limited to the realm of conjecture, modeling, and simulation due to the difficulty of altering this fundamental property of living organisms. Concerted genome and protein engineering efforts now make it possible to experimentally study the impact of alternative genetic codes on the evolution of biological systems. We explored how Escherichia coli strains that incorporate a 21st nonstandard amino acid (nsAA) at the recoded amber (TAG) stop codon evolve resistance to the antibiotic rifampicin. Resistance to rifampicin arises from chromosomal mutations in the beta subunit of RNA polymerase (RpoB). We found that a variety of mutations that lead to substitutions of nsAAs in the essential RpoB protein confer robust rifampicin resistance.

,Mismatch Correction Modulates Mutation Frequency and Pilus Phase and Antigenic Variation in Neisseria gonorrhoeae,JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY,"The mismatch correction (MMC) system repairs DNA mismatches and single nucleotide insertions or deletions postreplication. To test the functions of MMC in the obligate human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae, homologues of the core MMC genes mutS and mutL were inactivated in strain FA1090. No mutH homologue was found in the FA1090 genome, suggesting that gonococcal MMC is not methyl directed. MMC mutants were compared to a mutant in uvrD, the helicase that functions with MMC in Escherichia coli. Inactivation of MMC or uvrD increased spontaneous resistance to rifampin and nalidixic acid, and MMC/uvrD double mutants exhibited higher mutation frequencies than any single mutant. Loss of MMC marginally enhanced the transformation efficiency of DNA carrying a single nucleotide mismatch but not that of DNA with a 1-kb insertion. Unlike the exquisite UV sensitivity of the uvrD mutant, inactivating MMC did not affect survival after UV irradiation. MMC and uvrD mutants exhibited increased PilC-dependent pilus phase variation. mutS-deficient gonococci underwent an increased frequency of pilin antigenic variation, whereas uvrD had no effect.

,"Rifamycin resistance, rpoB gene mutation and clinical outcomes of Staphylococcus species isolates from prosthetic joint infections in Republic of Korea",JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE,"Objectives: We conducted an in vitro investigation of the activity of rifamycins against planktonic and biofilm states of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates from patients with prosthetic joint infections (PJIs), characterised their rpoB gene mutations, and analysed the clinical outcomes of rifampicin-resistant isolates. Methods: A total of 110 staphylococcal isolates were collected from patients with PJI. Antimicrobials tested using the broth microdilution method included rifampicin, rifabutin, rifapentine and rifaximin. We evaluated rpoB gene mutations to identify rifampicin resistance mechanisms. Clinical outcomes were assessed in rifampicin-resistant isolates. Results: The 110 staphylococcal isolates included 85 S. aureus (55% methicillin-resistant) and 25 S. epidermidis (100% methicillin-resistant). Seven S. aureus isolates and two S. epidermidis isolates were resistant to rifampicin [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) >= 2 mu g/mL] and these isolates exhibited rpoB gene mutations. Among the 78 rifampicin-susceptible S. aureus isolates and 23 S. epidermidis isolates, 76 S. aureus isolates (97.4%) and all S. epidermidis isolates (100%) were highly susceptible (MIC <= 0.06 mu g/mL) to other rifamycins.

Thus, ADP1 can be used to investigate DNA mismatch repair, a mechanism for repairing mismatched bases. We used the mutS deletion mutant (XH439) and mutL deletion mutant (XH440), and constructed a mutS mutL double deletion mutant (XH441) to investigate the role of the mismatch repair system in A. baylyi. Results We determined the survival rates after UV irradiation and measured the mutation frequencies, rates and spectra of wild-type ADP1 and mutSL mutant via rifampin resistance assay (Rif (R) assay) and experimental evolution. In addition, transformation efficiencies of genomic DNA in ADP1 and its three mutants were determined. Lastly, the relative growth rates of the wild type strain, three constructed deletion mutants, as well as the rifampin resistant mutants obtained from Rif (R) assays, were measured. All three mutants had higher survival rates after UV irradiation than wild type, especially the double deletion mutant. Three mutants showed higher mutation frequencies than ADP1 and favored transition mutations in Rif (R) assay. All three mutants showed increased mutation rates in the experimental evolution. However, only XH439 and XH441 had higher mutation rates than the wild type strain in Rif (R) assay. XH441 showed higher transformation efficiency than XH438 when donor DNA harbored transition mutations. All three mutants showed higher growth rates than wild-type, and these four strains displayed higher growth rates than almost all their rpoB mutants. The growth rate results showed different amino acid mutations in rpoB resulted in different extents of reduction in the fitness of rifampin resistant mutants. However, the fitness cost brought by the same mutation did not vary with strain background. Conclusions We demonstrated that inactivation of both mutS and mutL increased the mutation rates and frequencies in A. baylyi, which would contribute to the evolution and acquirement of rifampicin resistance.

,MUTANTS OF ESCHERICHIA-COLI WITH INCREASED FIDELITY OF DNA-REPLICATION,GENETICS,"To improve our understanding of the role of DNA replication fidelity in mutagenesis, we undertook a search for Escherichia coli antimutator strains with increased fidelity of DNA replication. The region between 4 and 5 min of the E. coli chromosome was mutagenized using localized mutagenesis mediated by bacteriophage P1. This region contains the dnaE and dnaQ genes, which encode, respectively, the DNA polymerase (alpha subunit) and 3' exonucleolytic proofreading activity (epsilon subunit) of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, the enzyme primarily responsible for replicating the bacterial chromosome. The mutated bacteria were screened for antimutator phenotype in a strain defective in DNA mismatch repair (mutL), using a papillation assay based on the reversion of the galK2 mutation. In a mutL strain, mutations result primarily from DNA replication errors. Among 10,000 colonies, seven mutants were obtained whose level of papillation was reduced 5-30-fold. These mutants also displayed decreased mutation frequencies for rifampicin or nalidixic acid resistance as well as for other markers.

,Aberrant repair initiated by the adenine-DNA glycosylase does not play a role in UV-induced mutagenesis in Escherichia coli,PEERJ,"Background: DNA repair is essential to counteract damage to DNA induced by endo- and exogenous factors, to maintain genome stability. However, challenges to the faithful discrimination between damaged and non-damaged DNA strands do exist, such as mismatched pairs between two regular bases resulting from spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine or DNA polymerase errors during replication. To counteract these mutagenic threats to genome stability, cells evolved the mismatch-specific DNA glycosylases that can recognize and remove regular DNA bases in the mismatched DNA duplexes. The Escherichia coli adenine-DNA glycosylase (MutY/MicA) protects cells against oxidative stress-induced mutagenesis by removing adenine which is mispaired with 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8oxoG) in the base excision repair pathway. However, MutY does not discriminate between template and newly synthesized DNA strands. Therefore the ability to remove A from 8oxoG center dot A mispair, which is generated via misincorporation of an 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate precursor during DNA replication and in which A is the template base, can induce A center dot T -> C center dot G transversions. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that human MUTYH, homologous to the bacterial MutY, might be involved in the aberrant processing of ultraviolet (UV) induced DNA damage. Methods: Here, we investigated the role of MutY in UV-induced mutagenesis in E. coli. MutY was probed on DNA duplexes containing cydobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproduct (6-4PP). UV irradiation of E. coli induces Save Our Souls (SOS) response characterized by increased production of DNA repair enzymes and mutagenesis. To study the role of MutY in vivo, the mutation frequencies to rifampicin-resistant (Rif(R)) after UV irradiation of wild type and mutant E. coli strains were measured. Results: We demonstrated that MutY does not excise Adenine when it is paired with CPD and 6-4PP adducts in duplex DNA. At the same time, MutY excises Adenine in A center dot G and A center dot 8oxoG mispairs. Interestingly, E. coli mutY strains, which have elevated spontaneous mutation rate, exhibited low mutational induction after UV exposure as compared to MutY-proficient strains. However, sequence analysis of Rif(R) mutants revealed that the frequencies of C -> T transitions dramatically increased after UV irradiation in both MutY-proficient and -deficient E. coli strains.

Global gene expression profiling revealed that nine genes WT E. coli and 100 genes in MV1932, of a total of 4290 genes, responded at least 2.5-fold to CLB. Interestingly, all of these MV1932 genes were downregulated, while 22% were upregulated in WT cells. The down-regulated genes in MV 1932 represented most (19/23) functional categories, and unexpectedly, many of them code for proteins responsible for genomic integrity. These include: (i) RecF (SOS-response, adaptive mutation), (ii) RecC (resistance to cross-linking agents), (iii) HepA (DNA repair, a possible substitute of RecBCD), (iv) Ssb (DNA recombination repair, controls RecBCD), and (v) SbcC (genetic recombination).

It did not influence the broth effect or the rate or extent of mutation frequency decline of suppressor mutations. In an excision-deficient (uvrA 155) background the yield of UV-induced streptomycin-resistant mutations was lower in gyrB bacteria at all doses; the yield of tryptophan-independent mutations was slightly lower at low doses and slightly higher at high doses. In both excision-proficient and -deficient bacteria the yield of UV-induced mutations to rifampicin resistance was apparently lower in gyrB mutants, but this could be due at least in part to a hypersensitivity of some Rifr gyrB bacteria to UV. The number of spontaneous tryptophan-independent mutations was lower in gyrB bacteria, but this was almost certainly due to their poorer viability on tryptophan-limiting plates and not to a lower spontaneous mutation rate. In a temperature-sensitive presumed gyrase-deficient strain a small decrease in mutant yield at low doses was observed following incubation at restrictive temperature before UV.

This response, termed UVM, for UV modulation of mutagenesis, is induced by a variety of DNA-damaging agents and is distinct from known cellular responses to DNA damage, including the SOS response. This report describes our observation, as a part of our investigation of the UVM phenomenon, that E. coli cells bearing a mutA or mutC allele display a UVM-constitutive phenotype. These mutator alleles were recently mapped (M. M. Slupska, C. Baikalov, R. Lloyd, and J. H. Miller, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:4380-4385, 1996) to the glyV (mutA) and glyW (mutC) tRNA genes. Each mutant allele was shown to arise by an identical mutation in the anticodon sequence such that the mutant tRNAs could, in principle, mistranslate aspartate codons in mRNA as glycine at a low level. Because a UVM-constitutive phenotype resulting from a mutation in a tRNA gene was unexpected, we undertook a series of experiments designed to test whether the phenotype was indeed mediated by the expression of mutant glycine tRNAs. We placed either a wild-type or a mutant glyV gene under the control of a heterologous inducible promoter on a plasmid vector. E. coli cells expressing the mutant glyV gene displayed all three of the following phenotypes: (i) missense suppression of a test allele, (ii) a mutator phenotype measured by Mutation to rifampin resistance, and (iii) a UVM-constitutive phenotype. These phenotypes were not associated with cells expressing the wild-type glyV gene or with cells in which the mutant allele was present but was not transcriptionally induced. These observations provide strong support for the idea that expression of mutant tRNA can confer a mutator phenotype, including the UVM-constitutive phenotype observed in mutA and mutC cells. However, our data imply that low-level mistranslation of the epsilon subunit of polymerase III probably does not account for the observed UVM-constitutive phenotype.

,Phenotypes and gene expression profiles of Saccharopolyspora erythraea rifampicin-resistant (rif) mutants affected in erythromycin production,MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES,"Background: There is evidence from previous works that bacterial secondary metabolism may be stimulated by genetic manipulation of RNA polymerase (RNAP). In this study we have used rifampicin selection as a strategy to genetically improve the erythromycin producer Saccharopolyspora erythraea. Results: Spontaneous rifampicin-resistant (rif) mutants were isolated from the parental strain NRRL2338 and two rif mutations mapping within rpoB, S444F and Q426R, were characterized. With respect to the parental strain, S444F mutants exhibited higher respiratory performance and up to four-fold higher final erythromycin yields; in contrast, Q426R mutants were slow-growing, developmental-defective and severely impaired in erythromycin production. DNA microarray analysis demonstrated that these rif mutations deeply changed the transcriptional profile of S. erythraea. The expression of genes coding for key enzymes of carbon (and energy) and nitrogen central metabolism was dramatically altered in turn affecting the flux of metabolites through erythromycin feeder pathways. In particular, the valine catabolic pathway that supplies propionyl-CoA for biosynthesis of the erythromycin precursor 6-deoxyerythronolide B was strongly up-regulated in the S444F mutants, while the expression of the biosynthetic gene cluster of erythromycin (ery) was not significantly affected. In contrast, the ery cluster was down-regulated (<2-fold) in the Q426R mutants. These strains also exhibited an impressive stimulation of the nitrogen regulon, which may contribute to lower erythromycin yields as erythromycin production was strongly inhibited by ammonium. Conclusion: Rifampicin selection is a simple and reliable tool to investigate novel links between primary and secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation in S. erythraea and to improve erythromycin production.

In 2011, a modified-live vaccine against columnaris disease was developed by selecting mutants that were resistant to rifampin. The previous study has suggested that this vaccine is stable, safe, and effective, but the mechanisms that resulted in attenuation remained uncharacterized. To understand the molecular basis for attenuation, a comparative genomic analysis was conducted to identify specific point mutations. The PacBio RS long-read sequencing platform was used to obtain draft genomes of the mutant attenuated strain (Fc1723) and the parent virulent strain (FcB27). Sequence-based genome comparison identified 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) unique to the mutant. Genes that contained mutations were involved in rifampin resistance, gliding motility, DNA transcription, toxin secretion, and extracellular protease synthesis.

Methods: Twelve spontaneous rifampicin-resistant E. faecium mutants were selected from four parent strains recently isolated from porcine faecal material. The DNA sequence of the complete rpoB gene from the parent strains and of nucleotides -189 to +1785 from the mutants was determined from PCR amplicons. The fitness of the mutants was assessed by determining growth rate, by direct growth competition and by the ability of some of the mutants to survive in the pig intestine. Results: The rpoB genes of the parent strains diverged from each other by 1-10% and each encoded proteins that were 1208 amino acids in length. All mutants had a single amino acid substitution in the region implicated in rifampicin resistance in other organisms.

,Linking System-Wide Impacts of RNA Polymerase Mutations to the Fitness Cost of Rifampin Resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa,MBIO,"Fitness costs play a key role in the evolutionary dynamics of antibiotic resistance in bacteria by generating selection against resistance in the absence of antibiotics. Although the genetic basis of antibiotic resistance is well understood, the precise molecular mechanisms linking the genetic basis of resistance to its fitness cost remain poorly characterized. Here, we examine how the system-wide impacts of mutations in the RNA polymerase (RNAP) gene rpoB shape the fitness cost of rifampin resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Rifampin resistance mutations reduce transcriptional efficiency, and this explains 76% of the variation in fitness among rpoB mutants. The pleiotropic consequence of rpoB mutations is that mutants show altered relative transcript levels of essential genes. We find no evidence that global transcriptional responses have an impact on the fitness cost of rifampin resistance as revealed by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Global changes in the transcriptional profiles of rpoB mutants compared to the transcriptional profile of the rifampin-sensitive ancestral strain are subtle, demonstrating that the transcriptional regulatory network of P. aeruginosa is robust to the decreased transcriptional efficiency associated with rpoB mutations. On a smaller scale, we find that rifampin resistance mutations increase the expression of RNAP due to decreased termination at an attenuator upstream from rpoB, and we argue that this helps to minimize the cost of rifampin resistance by buffering against reduced RNAP activity. In summary, our study shows that it is possible to dissect the molecular mechanisms underpinning variation in the cost of rifampin resistance and highlights the importance of genome-wide buffering of relative transcript levels in providing robustness against resistance mutations. IMPORTANCE Antibiotic resistance mutations carry fitness costs. Relative to the characteristics of their antibiotic-sensitive ancestors, resistant mutants show reduced growth rates and competitive abilities. Fitness cost plays an important role in the evolution of antibiotic resistance in the absence of antibiotics; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these fitness costs is not well understood. We applied a systems-level approach to dissect the molecular underpinnings of the fitness costs associated with rifampin resistance in P. aeruginosa and showed that most of the variation in fitness cost can be explained by the direct effect of resistance mutations on the enzymatic activity of the mutated gene.

Whether these resistance mutations are having parallel effects on fitness across bacterial taxa, however, is unclear. This is an important point to address, because the fitness effects of resistance mutations play a key role in the spread and maintenance of resistance in pathogen populations. We address this idea by measuring the fitness effect of a collection of rifampicin resistance mutations in the beta subunit of RNA polymerase (rpoB) across eight strains that span the diversity of the genus Pseudomonas. We find that almost 50% of rpoB mutations have background-dependent fitness costs, demonstrating that epistatic interactions between rpoB and the rest of the genome are common. Moreover, epistasis is typically strong, and it is the dominant genetic determinant of the cost of resistance mutations. To investigate the functional basis of epistasis, and because rpoB plays a central role in transcription, we measured the effects of common rpoB mutations on transcriptional efficiency across three strains of Pseudomonas.

Five overexpression strains were constructed using site-directed mutagenesis to validate these sites. To investigate the origin and fitness costs of the rpoB mutations, 15 types of rpoB mutations were isolated from R. anatipestifer ATCC 11845 by using spontaneous mutation in which R494K was identical to the type of mutation detected in the isolates.

,Rifampin Resistance Mutations Are Associated with Broad Chemical Remodeling of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY,"Global control of tuberculosis has become increasingly complicated with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. First-line treatments are anchored by two antibiotics, rifampin and isoniazid.

Although these mutations confer a survival advantage in the presence of rifampin, they may alter the normal process of transcription, thereby imposing significant fitness costs. Because the downstream biochemical consequences of the rpoB mutations are unknown, we used an organism-wide screen to identify the number and types of lipids changed after rpoB mutation. A new mass spectrometry-based profiling platform systematically compared approximate to 10,000 cell wall lipids in a panel of rifampin-resistant mutants within two genetically distinct strains, CDC1551and W-Beijing. This unbiased lipidomic survey detected quantitative alterations (>2-fold, p < 0.05) in more than 100 lipids in each mutant.

A total of 16 colonies with an RP62A background and 63 colonies with an IDRL-8883 background were analysed for rpoB mutations. The fitness of RIF-susceptible and isogenic RIF-resistant strains was assessed using a paired competition assay and by comparing generation times. All mutations detected were in cluster I of rpoB. The following five amino acid substitutions were selected in vitro: Asp471 -> Asn; Asp471 -> Gly; Asp471 -> Val; Ser486 -> Tyr; and His481 -> Tyr.

Experiments explored diverse mechanisms of re-sistance in a Gram-positive pathogen, Bacillus thuringiensis, and a Gram-negative in-testinal symbiont, Enterobacter cloacae.

Resistance against rifampin as one of the most important drugs in the treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is caused by mutations in the 81-base pair region of the rpoB gene encoding the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase. This study aimed to characterize the mutations in the rpoB gene associated with rifampin resistance among M. tuberculosis. METHODS: This study was conducted on referred samples of patients who did not respond to anti-TB treatment, in Tuberculosis Regional Reference Laboratory at Shariati Hospital. Drug susceptibility of M. tuberculosis isolates was surveyed using a proportional method on LJ medium. The isolates with resistant to rifampin were reconfirmed and then the rpoB gene was amplified and sequenced.

,Convergent Evolution Driven by Rifampin Exacerbates the Global Burden of Drug-Resistant &ITStaphylococcus aureus&IT,MSPHERE,"Mutations in the beta-subunit of bacterial RNA polymerase (RpoB) cause resistance to rifampin (Rif(r)), a critical antibiotic for treatment of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In vitro studies have shown that RpoB mutations confer decreased susceptibility to other antibiotics, but the clinical relevance is unknown. Here, by analyzing 7,099 S. aureus genomes, we demonstrate that the most prevalent RpoB mutations promote clinically relevant phenotypic plasticity resulting in the emergence of stable S. aureus lineages, associated with increased risk of therapeutic failure through generation of small-colony variants (SCVs) and coresistance to lastline antimicrobial agents. We found eight RpoB mutations that accounted for 93% (469/505) of the total number of Rif(r) mutations. The most frequently selected amino acid substitutions affecting residue 481 (H481N/Y) were associated with worldwide expansions of Rif(r) clones spanning decades. Recreating the H481N/Y mutations confirmed no impact on S. aureus growth, but the H481N mutation promoted the emergence of a subpopulation of stable Rif(r), SCVs with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin and daptomycin. Recreating the other frequent RpoB mutations showed similar impacts on resistance to these last-line agents. We found that 86% of all Rif(r) isolates in our global sample carried the mutations promoting cross-resistance to vancomycin and 52% to both vancomycin and daptomycin. As four of the most frequent RpoB mutations confer only low-level Rif(r), equal to or below some international breakpoints, we recommend decreasing these breakpoints and reconsidering the appropriate use of rifampin to reduce the fixation and spread of these clinically deleterious mutations. IMPORTANCE Increasing antibiotic resistance in the major human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is threatening the ability to treat patients with these infections. Recent laboratory studies suggest that mutations in the gene commonly associated with rifampin resistance may also impact susceptibility to other last-line antibiotics in S. aureus; however, the overall frequency and clinical impact of these mutations are unknown. By mining a global collection of clinical S. aureus genomes and by mutagenesis experiments, this work reveals that common rifampin-induced rpoB mutations promote phenotypic plasticity that has led to the global emergence of stable, multidrug-resistant S. aureus lineages that are associated with increased risk of therapeutic failure through coresistance to other last-line antimicrobials.

,Effect of Mutation and Genetic Background on Drug Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY,"Bacterial factors may contribute to the global emergence and spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). Only a few studies have reported on the interactions between different bacterial factors. We studied drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from a nationwide study conducted from 2000 to 2008 in Switzerland. We determined quantitative drug resistance levels of first-line drugs by using Bactec MGIT-960 and drug resistance genotypes by sequencing the hot-spot regions of the relevant genes. We determined recent transmission by molecular methods and collected clinical data. Overall, we analyzed 158 isolates that were resistant to isoniazid, rifampin, or ethambutol, 48 (30.4%) of which were multidrug resistant. Among 154 isoniazid-resistant strains, katG mutations were associated with high-level and inhA promoter mutations with low-level drug resistance. Only katG(S315T) (65.6% of all isoniazid-resistant strains) and inhA promoter -15C/T (22.7%) were found in molecular clusters. M. tuberculosis lineage 2 (includes Beijing genotype) was associated with any drug resistance (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 5.6; P < 0.0001). Lineage 1 was associated with inhA promoter -15C/T mutations (OR, 6.4; 95% CI, 2.0 to 20.7; P = 0.002). We found that the genetic strain background influences the level of isoniazid resistance conveyed by particular mutations (interaction tests of drug resistance mutations across all lineages; P < 0.0001). In conclusion, M. tuberculosis drug resistance mutations were associated with various levels of drug resistance and transmission, and M. tuberculosis lineages were associated with particular drug resistance-conferring mutations and phenotypic drug resistance.

,Impact of Ciprofloxacin Exposure on Staphylococcus aureus Genomic Alterations Linked with Emergence of Rifampin Resistance,ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY,"Intensive use of antimicrobial agents in health care settings not only leads to the selection of multiresistant nosocomial isolates of Staphylococcus aureus but may also promote endogenous, resistance-conferring mutations in bacterial genes that encode drug targets. We evaluated the spectrum of rifampin resistance-conferring mutations in cultures of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains exposed in vitro to sub-MICs of ciprofloxacin. Growth of ciprofloxacin-susceptible MRSA strain MRGR3 and ciprofloxacin-resistant MSSA strain RA1 (a NCTC 8325 derivative) in the presence of 1/2x or 1/4x MIC of ciprofloxacin led to higher frequencies of rifampin-resistant mutants on agar supplemented with rifampin (0.25 mg/liter) than under ciprofloxacin-free conditions. While rifampin-resistant mutants from ciprofloxacin-free cultures essentially showed single-amino-acid substitutions, a significant proportion of rifampin-resistant mutants from ciprofloxacin-exposed cultures displayed in-frame deletions or insertions in the rpoB gene at several positions of the rifampin resistance cluster I. In-frame deletions or insertions were also recorded in rpoB cluster I of rifampin-resistant mutants from ciprofloxacin-exposed cultures of mutS and mutL DNA repair mutants of ciprofloxacin-resistant S. aureus strain RA1. Frequencies of rifampin-resistant mutants grown under ciprofloxacin-free medium were higher for mutant strains RA1 mutS2 and RA1 mutL, but not RA1 recA, than for their parent RA1. In conclusion, ciprofloxacin-mediated DNA damage in S. aureus, as exemplified by the wide diversity of deletions or insertions in rpoB, suggests the occurrence of major, quinolone-mediated disturbances in DNA fork progression and replication repair.

,Evolving MRSA: High-level ???2-lactam resistance in Staphylococcus aureus is associated with RNA Polymerase alterations and fine tuning of gene expression,PLOS PATHOGENS,"Most clinical MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) isolates exhibit low-level beta -lactam resistance (oxacillin MIC 2-4 mu g/ml) due to the acquisition of a novel penicillin binding protein (PBP2A), encoded by mecA. However, strains can evolve high-level resistance (oxacillin MIC >= 256 mu g/ml) by an unknown mechanism. Here we have developed a robust system to explore the basis of the evolution of high-level resistance by inserting mecA into the chromosome of the methicillin-sensitive S. aureus SH1000. Low-level mecA-dependent oxacillin resistance was associated with increased expression of anaerobic respiratory and fermentative genes. High-level resistant derivatives had acquired mutations in either rpoB (RNA polymerase subunit beta) or rpoC (RNA polymerase subunit beta') and these mutations were shown to be responsible for the observed resistance phenotype. Analysis of rpoB and rpoC mutants revealed decreased growth rates in the absence of antibiotic, and alterations to, transcription elongation. The rpoB and rpoC mutations resulted in decreased expression to parental levels, of anaerobic respiratory and fermentative genes and specific upregulation of 11 genes including mecA. There was however no direct correlation between resistance and the amount of PBP2A. A mutational analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that a member of the S. aureus Type VII secretion system is required for high level resistance. Interestingly, the genomes of two of the high level resistant evolved strains also contained missense mutations in this same locus. Finally, the set of genetically matched strains revealed that high level antibiotic resistance does not incur a significant fitness cost during pathogenesis. Our analysis demonstrates the complex interplay between antibiotic resistance mechanisms and core cell physiology, providing new insight into how such important resistance properties evolve. Author summary Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) places a great burden on human healthcare systems. Resistance is mediated by the acquisition of a non-native penicillin-binding protein 2A (PBP2A), encoded by mecA. MRSA strains are resistant to virtually all beta -lactam antibiotics, and can shift from being low- to high-level resistant. Prior studies have revealed the involvement of components of the core genome in increased resistance, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. In this study, we have found that increased resistance is associated with mutations in either rpoB (RNA polymerase subunit beta) or rpoC (RNA polymerase subunit beta') resulting in slower growth and elevated levels of PBP2A. Furthermore, transcript profiling revealed that insertion of mecA triggered metabolic imbalance by altering anaerobic and fermentative gene expression, accompanied by low-level resistance whereas, acquisition of rpoB and rpoC mutations reversed gene expression to wild-type level and enabled cells to become highly-resistant. The mutations also affected RNA polymerase activity. A set of matched strains revealed that changes in antibiotic resistance levels do not have a significant cost in terms of pathogenic potential. Our study reveals a novel effect of mecA acquisition on central metabolism and sheds light on potential pathways essential for high-level resistance.",2020,,10.1371/journal.ppat.1008672,WOS:000559728900001,,"evolving mrsa: high-level ??a2-lactam resistance in staphylococcus aureus is associated with rna polymerase alterations and fine tuning of gene expression most clinical mrsa (methicillin-resistant s. aureus) isolates exhibit low-level beta -lactam resistance (oxacillin mic 2-4 mu g/ml) due to the acquisition of a novel penicillin binding protein (pbp2a), encoded by meca. however, strains can evolve high-level resistance (oxacillin mic >= 256 mu g/ml) by an unknown mechanism. here we have developed a robust system to explore the basis of the evolution of high-level resistance by inserting meca into the chromosome of the methicillin-sensitive s. aureus sh1000. low-level meca-dependent oxacillin resistance was associated with increased expression of anaerobic respiratory and fermentative genes. high-level resistant derivatives had acquired mutations in either rpob (rna polymerase subunit beta) or rpoc (rna polymerase subunit beta') and these mutations were shown to be responsible for the observed resistance phenotype. analysis of rpob and rpoc mutants revealed decreased growth rates in the absence of antibiotic, and alterations to, transcription elongation. the rpob and rpoc mutations resulted in decreased expression to parental levels, of anaerobic respiratory and fermentative genes and specific upregulation of 11 genes including meca. there was however no direct correlation between resistance and the amount of pbp2a. a mutational analysis of the differentially expressed genes revealed that a member of the s. aureus type vii secretion system is required for high level resistance. interestingly, the genomes of two of the high level resistant evolved strains also contained missense mutations in this same locus. finally, the set of genetically matched strains revealed that high level antibiotic resistance does not incur a significant fitness cost during pathogenesis. our analysis demonstrates the complex interplay between antibiotic resistance mechanisms and core cell physiology, providing new insight into how such important resistance properties evolve. author summary methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) places a great burden on human healthcare systems. resistance is mediated by the acquisition of a non-native penicillin-binding protein 2a (pbp2a), encoded by meca. mrsa strains are resistant to virtually all beta -lactam antibiotics, and can shift from being low- to high-level resistant. prior studies have revealed the involvement of components of the core genome in increased resistance, but the underlying mechanism is still unknown. in this study, we have found that increased resistance is associated with mutations in either rpob (rna polymerase subunit beta) or rpoc (rna polymerase subunit beta') resulting in slower growth and elevated levels of pbp2a. furthermore, transcript profiling revealed that insertion of meca triggered metabolic imbalance by altering anaerobic and fermentative gene expression, accompanied by low-level resistance whereas, acquisition of rpob and rpoc mutations reversed gene expression to wild-type level and enabled cells to become highly-resistant. the mutations also affected rna polymerase activity. a set of matched strains revealed that changes in antibiotic resistance levels do not have a significant cost in terms of pathogenic potential. our study reveals a novel effect of meca acquisition on central metabolism and sheds light on potential pathways essential for high-level resistance.",,,10.1371/journal.ppat.1008672||WOS:000559728900001,896,"Panchal, VV; Griffiths, C; Mosaei, H; Bilyk, B; Sutton, JAF; Carnell, OT; Hornby, DP; Green, J; Hobbs, JK; Kelley, WL; Zenkin, N; Foster, SJ",0,,1,,FALSE,,
,Adaptation Through Lifestyle Switching Sculpts the Fitness Landscape of Evolving Populations: Implications for the Selection of Drug-Resistant Bacteria at Low Drug Pressures,GENETICS,"Novel genotypes evolve under selection through mutations in pre-existing genes. However, mutations have pleiotropic phenotypic effects that influence the fitness of emerging genotypes in complex ways. The evolution of antimicrobial resistance is mediated by selection of mutations in genes coding for antibiotic-target proteins. Drug-resistance is commonly associated with a fitness cost due to the impact of resistance-conferring mutations on protein function and/or stability. These costs are expected to prohibit the selection of drug-resistant mutations at low drug pressures. Using laboratory evolution of rifampicin resistance in Escherichia coli, we show that when exposed intermittently to low concentration (0.1 x minimal inhibitory concentration) of rifampicin, the evolution of canonical drug resistance was indeed unfavorable. Instead, these bacterial populations adapted by evolving into small-colony variants that displayed enhanced pellicle-forming ability. This shift in lifestyle from planktonic to pellicle-like was necessary for enhanced fitness at low drug pressures, and was mediated by the genetic activation of the fim operon promoter, which allowed expression of type I fimbriae. Upon continued low drug exposure, these bacteria evolved exclusively into high-level drug-resistant strains through mutations at a limited set of loci within the rifampicin-resistance determining region of the rpoB gene. We show that our results are explained by mutation-specific epistasis, resulting in differential impact of lifestyle switching on the competitive fitness of different rpoB mutations. Thus, lifestyle-alterations that are selected at low selection pressures have the potential to modify the fitness effects of mutations, change the genetic structure, and affect the ultimate fate of evolving populations.",2019,,10.1534/genetics.119.301834,WOS:000460597200016,,"adaptation through lifestyle switching sculpts the fitness landscape of evolving populations: implications for the selection of drug-resistant bacteria at low drug pressures novel genotypes evolve under selection through mutations in pre-existing genes. however, mutations have pleiotropic phenotypic effects that influence the fitness of emerging genotypes in complex ways. the evolution of antimicrobial resistance is mediated by selection of mutations in genes coding for antibiotic-target proteins. drug-resistance is commonly associated with a fitness cost due to the impact of resistance-conferring mutations on protein function and/or stability. these costs are expected to prohibit the selection of drug-resistant mutations at low drug pressures. using laboratory evolution of rifampicin resistance in escherichia coli, we show that when exposed intermittently to low concentration (0.1 x minimal inhibitory concentration) of rifampicin, the evolution of canonical drug resistance was indeed unfavorable. instead, these bacterial populations adapted by evolving into small-colony variants that displayed enhanced pellicle-forming ability. this shift in lifestyle from planktonic to pellicle-like was necessary for enhanced fitness at low drug pressures, and was mediated by the genetic activation of the fim operon promoter, which allowed expression of type i fimbriae. upon continued low drug exposure, these bacteria evolved exclusively into high-level drug-resistant strains through mutations at a limited set of loci within the rifampicin-resistance determining region of the rpob gene. we show that our results are explained by mutation-specific epistasis, resulting in differential impact of lifestyle switching on the competitive fitness of different rpob mutations. thus, lifestyle-alterations that are selected at low selection pressures have the potential to modify the fitness effects of mutations, change the genetic structure, and affect the ultimate fate of evolving populations.",,,10.1534/genetics.119.301834||WOS:000460597200016,968,"Matange, N; Hegde, S; Bodkhe, S",0,,1,,FALSE,doubtful,
,High-efficiency generation of antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae by PCR and transformation,ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY,"We designed a method by which to generate antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae at frequencies 4 orders of magnitude greater than the spontaneous mutation rate. The method is based on the natural ability of this organism to be genetically transformed with PCR products carrying sequences homologous to its chromosome. The genes encoding the targets of ciprofloxacin (parC, encoding the ParC subunit of DNA topoisomerase IV), rifampin (rpoB, encoding the P subunit of RNA polymerase), and streptomycin (rpsL, encoding the S12 ribosomal protein) from susceptible laboratory strain R6 were amplified by PCR and used to transform the same strain. Resistant mutants were obtained with a frequency of 10(-4) to 10(-5), depending on the fidelity of the DNA polymerase used for PCR amplifications. Ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants, for which the MICs were four-to eightfold higher than that for R6, carried a single mutation of a residue in the quinolone resistance-determining region: S79 (change to A, F, or Y) or D83 (change to N or V). Rifampin-resistant strains, for which the MICs were at least 133-fold higher than that for R6, contained a single mutation within cluster I of rpoB: S482 (change to P), Q486 (change to L), D489 (change to V), or H499 (change to L or Y). Streptomycin-resistant mutants, for which the MICs were at least 64-fold higher than that for R6, carried a mutation at either K56 (change to I, R, or T) or K101 (change to E). PCR products obtained from the mutants were able to transform R6 to resistance with high efficiency (> 10(4)).

,Development and characterisation of highly antibiotic resistant Bartonella bacilliformis mutants,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,"The objective was to develop and characterise in vitro Bartonella bacilliformis antibiotic resistant mutants. Three B. bacilliformis strains were plated 35 or 40 times with azithromycin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin or rifampicin discs. Resistance-stability was assessed performing 5 serial passages without antibiotic pressure. MICs were determined with/without Phe-Arg-beta-Napthylamide and artesunate. Target alterations were screened in the 23S rRNA, rplD, rplV, gyrA, gyrB, parC, parE and rpoB genes. Chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin resistance were the most difficult and easiest (> 37.3 and 10.6 passages) to be selected, respectively. All mutants but one selected with chloramphenicol achieved high resistance levels. All rifampicin, one azithromycin and one ciprofloxacin mutants did not totally revert when cultured without antibiotic pressure. Azithromycin resistance was related to L4 substitutions Gln-66 -> Lys or Gly-70 -> Arg; L4 deletion Delta(62-65) (Lys-Met-Tyr-Lys) or L22 insertion 83:: Val-Ser-Glu-Ala-His-Val-Gly-Lys-Ser; in two chloramphenicol-resistant mutants the 23S rRNA mutation G2372A was detected. GyrA Ala-91 -> Val and Asp-95 -> Gly and GyrB Glu474 -> Lys were detected in ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants. RpoB substitutions Gln-527 -> Arg, His-540 -> Tyr and Ser-545 -> Phe plus Ser-588 -> Tyr were detected in rifampicin-resistant mutants.

,Emergence of resistance to rifampin and rifalazil in Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis,ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY,"Although rifamycins have excellent activity against Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Chlamydia trachomatis in vitro, concerns about the possible development of resistance during therapy have discouraged their use for treatment of chlamydial infections. Rifalazil, a new semisynthetic rifamycin with a long half-life, is the most active antimicrobial against C pneumoniae and C trachomatis in vitro, indicating its potential for treatment of acute and chronic C pneumoniae and C trachomatis infections. We investigated the effect of serial passage of two C. pneumoniae isolates and two serotypes of C. trachomatis in subinhibitory concentrations of rifalazil and rifampin on the development of phenotypic and genotypic resistance. C trachomatis developed resistance to both antimicrobials within six passages, with higher level resistance to rifampin (128 to 256 mug/ml) and lower level resistance to rifalazil (0.5 to 1 1 mug/ml). C pneumoniae TW-183 developed only low-level resistance to rifampin (0.25 mug/ml) and rifalazil (0.016 mug/ml) after 12 passages. C pneumoniae CWL-029 failed to develop resistance to either drug. Two unique mutations emerged in the rpoB gene of rifampin (L4561) and rifalazil (D461E) -resistant C pneumoniae TW-183. A single mutation (H471Y) was detected in both rifampin- and rifalazil-resistant C. trachomatis UW-3/Cx/D, and a unique mutation (V136F) was found in rifalazil -resistant BU-434/L-2. No mutations were detected in the entire rpoB gene of rifampin-resistant BU-434/L2.
