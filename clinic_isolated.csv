"Suchland, RJ; Sandoz, KM; Jeffrey, BM; Stamm, WE; Rockey, DD",Horizontal Transfer of Tetracycline Resistance among Chlamydia spp. In Vitro,ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY,"There are no examples of stable tetracycline resistance in clinical strains of Chlamydia trachomatis. However, the swine pathogen Chlamydia suis is commonly tetracycline resistant, both in America and in Europe. In tested U. S. strains, this resistance is mediated by a genomic island carrying a tet(C) allele. In the present study, the ability of C. suis to mobilize tet( C) into other chlamydial species was examined. Differently antibiotic resistant strains of C. suis, C. trachomatis, and Chlamydia muridarum were used in coculture experiments to select for multiply antibiotic resistant progeny. Coinfection of mammalian cells with a naturally occurring tetracycline-resistant strain of C. suis and a C. muridarum or C. trachomatis strain containing selected mutations encoding rifampin ( rifampicin) or ofloxacin resistance readily produced doubly resistant recombinant clones that demonstrated the acquisition of tetracycline resistance. The resistance phenotype in the progeny from a C. trachomatis L2/ofl(R)-C. suis R19/tet(R) cross resulted from integration of a 40-kb fragment into a single ribosomal operon of a recipient, leading to a merodiploid structure containing three rRNA operons. In contrast, a cross between C. suis R19/tet(R) and C. muridarum MoPn/ofl(R) led to a classical double-crossover event transferring 99 kb of DNA from C. suis R19/tet(R) into C. muridarum MoPn/ofl(R). Tetracycline resistance was also transferred to recent clinical strains of C. trachomatis. Successful crosses were not obtained when a rifampin-resistant Chlamydophila caviae strain was used as a recipient for crosses with C. suis or C. trachomatis. These findings provide a platform for further exploration of the biology of horizontal gene transfer in Chlamydia while bringing to light potential public health concerns generated by the possibility of acquisition of tetracycline resistance by human chlamydial pathogens.",2009,,10.1128/AAC.00477-09,WOS:000270881200005,10.1128/AAC.00477-09||WOS:000270881200005,"horizontal transfer of tetracycline resistance among chlamydia spp. in vitro there are no examples of stable tetracycline resistance in clinical strains of chlamydia trachomatis. however, the swine pathogen chlamydia suis is commonly tetracycline resistant, both in america and in europe. in tested u. s. strains, this resistance is mediated by a genomic island carrying a tet(c) allele. in the present study, the ability of c. suis to mobilize tet( c) into other chlamydial species was examined. differently antibiotic resistant strains of c. suis, c. trachomatis, and chlamydia muridarum were used in coculture experiments to select for multiply antibiotic resistant progeny. coinfection of mammalian cells with a naturally occurring tetracycline-resistant strain of c. suis and a c. muridarum or c. trachomatis strain containing selected mutations encoding rifampin ( rifampicin) or ofloxacin resistance readily produced doubly resistant recombinant clones that demonstrated the acquisition of tetracycline resistance. the resistance phenotype in the progeny from a c. trachomatis l2/ofl(r)-c. suis r19/tet(r) cross resulted from integration of a 40-kb fragment into a single ribosomal operon of a recipient, leading to a merodiploid structure containing three rrna operons. in contrast, a cross between c. suis r19/tet(r) and c. muridarum mopn/ofl(r) led to a classical double-crossover event transferring 99 kb of dna from c. suis r19/tet(r) into c. muridarum mopn/ofl(r). tetracycline resistance was also transferred to recent clinical strains of c. trachomatis. successful crosses were not obtained when a rifampin-resistant chlamydophila caviae strain was used as a recipient for crosses with c. suis or c. trachomatis. these findings provide a platform for further exploration of the biology of horizontal gene transfer in chlamydia while bringing to light potential public health concerns generated by the possibility of acquisition of tetracycline resistance by human chlamydial pathogens.",0.5696191,1.0,10.1128/AAC.00477-09||WOS:000270881200005,,,,,,,True

Other studies have found strong associations between embB306 mutations and multidrug resistance, but not EMB resistance. We performed allelic exchange studies in EMB-susceptible and EMB-resistant clinical H. tuberculosis isolates to identify the role of embB306 mutations in any type of drug resistance. Replacing wild-type embB306 ATG from EMB-susceptible clinical M. tuberculosis strain 210 with embB306 ATA, ATC, CTG, or GTG increased the EMB MIC from 2 mu g/ml to 7, 7, 8.5, and 14 mu g/ml, respectively. Replacing embB306 ATC or GTG from two high-level EMB-resistant clinical strains with wild-type ATG lowered EMB MICs from 20 mu g/ml or 28 mu g/ml, respectively, to 3 mu g/ml. All parental and isogenic mutant strains had identical isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) MICs. However, embB306 CTG mutants had growth advantages compared to strain 210 at sub-MICs of INH or RIF in monocultures and at sub-MICs of INH in competition assays. CTG mutants were also more resistant to the additive or synergistic activities of INH, RIF, or EMB used in different combinations. These results demonstrate that embB306 mutations cause an increase in the EMB MIC, a variable degree of EMB resistance, and are necessary but not sufficient for high-level EMB resistance. The unusual growth property of embB306 mutants in other antibiotics suggests that they may be amplified during treatment in humans and that a single mutation may affect antibiotic susceptibility against multiple first-line antibiotics.",2008,,10.1128/AAC.01486-07,WOS:000256272700019,10.1128/AAC.01486-07||WOS:000256272700019,"transfer of embb codon 306 mutations into clinical mycobacterium tuberculosis strains alters susceptibility to ethambutol, isoniazid, and rifampin implicated as a major mechanism of ethambutol (emb) resistance in clinical studies of mycobacterium tuberculosis, mutations in codon 306 of the embb gene (embb306) have also been detected in emb-susceptible clinical isolates. other studies have found strong associations between embb306 mutations and multidrug resistance, but not emb resistance. we performed allelic exchange studies in emb-susceptible and emb-resistant clinical h. tuberculosis isolates to identify the role of embb306 mutations in any type of drug resistance. replacing wild-type embb306 atg from emb-susceptible clinical m. tuberculosis strain 210 with embb306 ata, atc, ctg, or gtg increased the emb mic from 2 mu g/ml to 7, 7, 8.5, and 14 mu g/ml, respectively. replacing embb306 atc or gtg from two high-level emb-resistant clinical strains with wild-type atg lowered emb mics from 20 mu g/ml or 28 mu g/ml, respectively, to 3 mu g/ml. all parental and isogenic mutant strains had identical isoniazid (inh) and rifampin (rif) mics. however, embb306 ctg mutants had growth advantages compared to strain 210 at sub-mics of inh or rif in monocultures and at sub-mics of inh in competition assays. ctg mutants were also more resistant to the additive or synergistic activities of inh, rif, or emb used in different combinations. these results demonstrate that embb306 mutations cause an increase in the emb mic, a variable degree of emb resistance, and are necessary but not sufficient for high-level emb resistance. the unusual growth property of embb306 mutants in other antibiotics suggests that they may be amplified during treatment in humans and that a single mutation may affect antibiotic susceptibility against multiple first-line antibiotics.",0.49537387,1.0,10.1128/AAC.01486-07||WOS:000256272700019,,,,,,,True

,Mechanisms of Staphylococcus aureus Antibiotics Resistance Revealed by Adaptive Laboratory Evolution,CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY,"Infection caused by drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a serious public health and veterinary concern. Lack of a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the emergence of drug-resistant strains, it makes S. aureus one of the most intractable pathogenic bacteria.

We discovered a panel of known and novel resistance-associated sites after performing whole-genome sequencing. Furthermore, we found that the resistance evolved at distinct rates. For example, streptomycin, rifampicin, fusidic acid and novobiocin all developed significant resistance quickly in the second round of evolution. Intriguingly, the cross-resistance experiment reveals that nearly all drug-resistant strains have varying degrees of increased sensitivity to fusidic acid, pointing to a novel approach to battle AMR.

,Rifampicin and rifabutin resistance in 1003 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates,JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY,"Objectives: Drug-resistant TB remains a public health challenge. Rifamycins are among the most potent anti-TB drugs. They are known to target the RpoB subunit of RNA polymerase; however, our understanding of how rifamycin resistance is genetically encoded remains incomplete. Here we investigated rpoB genetic diversity and cross-resistance between the two rifamycin drugs rifampicin and rifabutin. Methods: We performed WGS of 1003 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates and determined MICs of both rifamycin agents on 7H10 agar using the indirect proportion method. We generated rpoB mutants in a laboratory strain and measured their antibiotic susceptibility using the alamarBlue reduction assay. Results: Of the 1003 isolates, 766 were rifampicin resistant and 210 (27%) of these were rifabutin susceptible; 102/210 isolates had the rpoB mutation D435V (Escherichia coli D516V). Isolates with discordant resistance were 17.2 times more likely to harbour a D435V mutation than those resistant to both agents (OR 17.2, 95% CI 10.5-27.9, P value, <10(-40)).

,Investigation of Efflux Pump Genes in Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex Clinical Isolates Exposed to First Line Antituberculosis Drugs and Verapamil Combination,MIKROBIYOLOJI BULTENI,"Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, still one of the most common life -threat-ening infectious diseases worldwide. Although drug resistance in M.tuberculosis is mainly due to spon-taneous chromosomal mutations in genes encoding drug target or drug activating enzymes, the resist-ance cannot be explained only by these mutations. Low permeability of the cell wall, drug inactivating enzymes and especially efflux pumps (EPs) are other mechanisms of drug resistance in mycobacteria. Efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) binding to M.tuberculosis EPs were shown to inhibit efflux of anti-TB drugs, to enhance M.tuberculosis killing, to reduce drug resistance and to produce synergistic effects with first line anti-TB drugs. In this study, we aimed to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of first-line anti-TB drugs in the presence of verapamil (VER) and the expression of 21 putative EP genes belonged to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC), major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and resistance-nodu- lation-division (RND) families which might have caused the resistance in nine M.tuberculosis complex clinical isolates resistant to all of the first line anti-TB drugs. MIC values of the isolates were determined in 96-well U-bottom plates by the resazurin microtiter test (REMA) method based on the color change principle. According to the determined MIC values of each isolate, freshly grown cultures in Middlebrook 7H9 broth were exposed to first-line anti-TB drugs and MIC of first-line anti-TB drugs in the presence of VER (Y2 MIC) at 37 degrees C for 48 hours for RNA extraction. The non-drug exposed cultures were used as control. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and then treated with DNase I (Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) from the extracted RNAs was synthesized with the First strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) using oligo primers. The expression levels of efflux pump genes by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRt-PCR) were performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green Rt-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The housekeeping sigma factor gene sigA (Rv2703) was used as internal control in qRt-PCR assays. Relative quantification of the clinical isolates was determined by the 2- increment increment Ct method by comparing the expression levels of efflux genes in cultures exposed to primary anti-TB drugs and VER with those of non-drug exposed cultures. MIC values of nine isolates by REMA method was determined between 32-512 pg/mL, 1-128 pg/mL, 2-32 pg/mL, 4-16 pg/mL and 15.62-250 pg/mL for streptomycin (SM), isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol (EMB) and VER, respectively. In the presence of 1/2 MIC VER, it was determined that the MIC of SM decreased 2-32 fold in eight isolates, the MIC of INH decreased by 2-8 fold in nine isolates, the MIC of RIF decreased by 2-16 fold in eight isolates, and the MIC of EMB decreased 2-4 fold in only five isolates. There was an increase in the expression of Rv1273c, Rv1456c, Rv1457 and Rv1819 efflux pump genes from the ABC family, Rv1634 and Rv0842 from the MFS family and Rv3823 efflux from the RND family in isolates exposed to 1/2 MIC of first-line anti-TB drugs stress.

,Rifamycin inhibition of WT and Rif-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Escherichia coli RNA polymerases in vitro,TUBERCULOSIS,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infects over 9 million people globally and claims approximately 2 million lives annually. Rifampin (Rif) is one of the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs that inhibits transcription by binding to the beta subunit (encoded by the rpoB gene) of the prokaryotic RNA polymerase (RNAP). A highly conserved 81 base pair core region among the b subunit of prokaryotes harbors most of the point mutations leading to rifamycin-resistant (RifR) mutations, where the majority of the clinically relevant MTB RifR mutations result from amino acid substitutions of one of the following three amino acids: beta Asp435, beta His445, and beta Ser450 (MTB numbering). In this study, to determine the direct effect of rifamycins on the MTB RNAP, co-overexpression vectors were constructed to co-express the core subunits of wild-type and RifR mutants of MTB RNAP. The three aforementioned amino acids were each mutated to the most prevalent substitution found in the MTB clinical isolates (Asp435Val, His445Tyr, Ser450Leu) in the rpoB gene via site-directed mutagenesis. After purification via two-step column chromatography, the in vitro activity of the wild-type and RifR mutant MTB RNAPs was assessed via rolling circle transcription assay. The apparent IC50 values for three key rifamycins (rifampin (Rif), rifabutin (Rbn), and rifaximin (Rfx)) were determined and these results indicate that the mutant RNAPs demonstrate approximately 10(3)-fold or greater loss of affinities for rifamycins relative to wild-type MTB RNAP. Along with the MTB RNAPs, rifamycin inhibition of the Escherichia coli RNAP counterparts was also assessed. Previously, it has been reported that Gram-positive bacteria (particularly mycobacteria) are more sensitive to rifamycins than Gram-negative bacteria. Under our experimental conditions, the rifamycin IC(50)s for wild-type and RifR mutants of MTB and E. coli RNAPs (wild-type and corresponding mutants) were very similar; therefore, the difference in sensitivity toward rifamycins does not reside in the RNAP itself. The correlation between the sensitivity of rifamycins and permeability into cells was evaluated using the wild-type E. coli strains (TG2 and DH5 alpha) and a mutant E. coli strain with efflux pump defects (EC2880, tolC(-)/imp(-)). The MICs were drastically lower in the EC2880 strain, consistent with previous reports that the differential sensitivity of MTB and E. coli to rifamycins is not related to the RNAP, but rather has to do with efflux pumps in E. coli. Future work will focus on the elucidation of the molecular interaction of these MTB RifR mutants with rifamycins to provide insight to the design of novel rifamycins. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

,Mismatch repair and the regulation of phase variation in Neisseria meningitidis,MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY,"Neisseria meningitidis controls the expression of several genes involved in host adaptation by a process known as phase variation. The phase variation frequency of haemoglobin (Hb) receptors among clinical isolates of serogroups A, B and C differed drastically, ranging from approximate to 10(-6) to 10(-2) cfu(-1). Frequencies of phase variation are a genetic trait of a particular strain, as two unlinked Hb receptors, hpuAB and hmbR, phase varied with similar frequencies within a given isolate. Based on these frequencies, six Neisserial clinical isolates could be grouped into three distinct classes; slow, medium and fast. An increase in phase variation frequency was accompanied by high rates of spontaneous mutation to rifampicin and nalidixic acid resistance in one medium and one fast strain. The remaining three medium strains displayed elevated levels of phase variation without increases in overall mutability, as they possessed low rates of spontaneous mutation to drug resistance. The mismatch repair system of N. meningitidis was found to play an important role in determining the overall mutability of the clinical isolates. Inactivation of mismatch repair in any strain, regardless of its original phenotype, increased mutability to a level seen in the fast strain. Insertional inactivation of mutS and mutL in the slow strain led to 500- and 250-fold increases in hmbR switching frequency respectively. Concurrently, the frequency of spontaneous point mutations of mutS and mutL mutants from the slow strain was increased 20- to 30-fold to the level seen in the high strain. The status of Dam methylation did not correlate with either the phase variation frequency of Hb receptors or the general mutability of Neisserial strains. Analysis of an expanded set of isolates identified defects in mismatch repair as the genetic basis for strains displaying both the fast Hb switching and high mutation rate phenotypes. In conclusion, elevated frequencies of phase variation were accompanied by increased overall mutability in some N. meningitidis isolates including strains shown to be mismatch repair defective. Other isolates have evolved mechanisms that seem to affect only the switching frequency of phase-variable genes without an accompanied increased accumulation of spontaneous mutations.",2001,,10.1046/j.1365-2958.2001.02408.x,WOS:000168748300012,,"mismatch repair and the regulation of phase variation in neisseria meningitidis neisseria meningitidis controls the expression of several genes involved in host adaptation by a process known as phase variation. the phase variation frequency of haemoglobin (hb) receptors among clinical isolates of serogroups a, b and c differed drastically, ranging from approximate to 10(-6) to 10(-2) cfu(-1). frequencies of phase variation are a genetic trait of a particular strain, as two unlinked hb receptors, hpuab and hmbr, phase varied with similar frequencies within a given isolate. based on these frequencies, six neisserial clinical isolates could be grouped into three distinct classes; slow, medium and fast. an increase in phase variation frequency was accompanied by high rates of spontaneous mutation to rifampicin and nalidixic acid resistance in one medium and one fast strain. the remaining three medium strains displayed elevated levels of phase variation without increases in overall mutability, as they possessed low rates of spontaneous mutation to drug resistance. the mismatch repair system of n. meningitidis was found to play an important role in determining the overall mutability of the clinical isolates. inactivation of mismatch repair in any strain, regardless of its original phenotype, increased mutability to a level seen in the fast strain. insertional inactivation of muts and mutl in the slow strain led to 500- and 250-fold increases in hmbr switching frequency respectively. concurrently, the frequency of spontaneous point mutations of muts and mutl mutants from the slow strain was increased 20- to 30-fold to the level seen in the high strain. the status of dam methylation did not correlate with either the phase variation frequency of hb receptors or the general mutability of neisserial strains. analysis of an expanded set of isolates identified defects in mismatch repair as the genetic basis for strains displaying both the fast hb switching and high mutation rate phenotypes. in conclusion, elevated frequencies of phase variation were accompanied by increased overall mutability in some n. meningitidis isolates including strains shown to be mismatch repair defective. other isolates have evolved mechanisms that seem to affect only the switching frequency of phase-variable genes without an accompanied increased accumulation of spontaneous mutations.",,,10.1046/j.1365-2958.2001.02408.x||WOS:000168748300012,962.0,"Richardson, AR; Stojiljkovic, I",0.0,,1.0,,True

,Effect of rpoB mutations conferring rifampin resistance on fitness of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY,"Rifampin is a major drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis infections, and increasing rifampin resistance represents a worldwide clinical problem. Resistance to rifampin is caused by mutations in the rpoB gene, encoding the beta-subunit of RNA polymerase. We examined the effect of three different rpoB mutations on the fitness of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Rifampin-resistant mutants were isolated from a virulent clinical isolate of M. tuberculosis (strain Harlingen) in vitro at a mutation frequency of 2.3 X 10(-8). Mutations in the rpoB gene were identified, and the growth rates of three defined mutants were measured by competition with the susceptible parent strain in laboratory medium and by single cultures in a macrophage cell line and in laboratory medium. All of the mutants showed a decreased growth rate in the three assays.

,"Pre-Existing Isoniazid Resistance, but Not the Genotype of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Drives Rifampicin Resistance Codon Preference in Vitro",PLOS ONE,"Both the probability of a mutation occurring and the ability of the mutant to persist will influence the distribution of mutants that arise in a population. We studied the interaction of these factors for the in vitro selection of rifampicin (RIF)resistant mutants of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We characterised two series of spontaneous RIF-resistant in vitro mutants from isoniazid (INH)-sensitive and -resistant laboratory strains and clinical isolates, representing various M. tuberculosis genotypes. The first series were selected from multiple parallel 1 ml cultures and the second from single 10 ml cultures. RIF-resistant mutants were screened by Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) or by sequencing the rpoB gene. For all strains the mutation rate for RIF resistance was determined with a fluctuation assay. The most striking observation was a shift towards rpoB-S531L (TCG -> TTG) mutations in a panel of laboratory-generated INH-resistant mutants selected from the 10-ml cultures (p<0.001). All tested strains showed similar mutation rates (1.33x10(-8) to 2.49x10(-7)) except one of the laboratory-generated INH mutants with a mutation rate measured at 5.71x10(-7), more than 10 times higher than that of the INH susceptible parental strain (5.46-7.44x10(-8)). No significant, systematic difference in the spectrum of rpoB-mutations between strains of different genotypes was observed. The dramatic shift towards rpoB-S531L in our INH-resistant laboratory mutants suggests that the relative fitness of resistant mutants can dramatically impact the distribution of (subsequent) mutations that accumulate in a M. tuberculosis population, at least in vitro. We conclude that, against specific genetic backgrounds, certain resistance mutations are particularly likely to spread.

Methods: For rifampicin-resistant isolates, the rpoB gene fragment that includes the most frequent mutations conferring rifampicin resistance in S. aureus was amplified and sequenced. The role of new mutations responsible for rifampicin resistance was confirmed by cloning and complementation in trans. Resistant isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing and PFGE. Results: Between 1999 and 2008, 0.59% (96/16348) of S. aureus clinical isolates studied showed rifampicin resistance. Rifampicin resistance was higher in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) than in methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (3.26% versus 0.26%; P<0.001). Twenty-two randomly selected rifampicin-resistant isolates were studied in depth, 11 showing low-level and 11 showing high-level rifampicin resistance (rifampicin MICs of 2-4 mg/L and >= 8 mg/L, respectively). Overall, 12 different mutations in the rpoB gene were detected, including a newly described N474K mutation followed by the insertion of a glycine residue at position 475. Among the eight different sequence types (STs) found, the most frequent were ST8 and ST863, the latter being associated with respiratory infections. Ten of the 11 low-level rifampicin-resistant isolates were MRSA ST8 and had the same H481N mutation, while the 11 high-level rifampicin-resistant isolates, 6 MSSA and 5 MRSA, belonged to eight different STs and had distinct rpoB mutations. Conclusions: Low-level rifampicin-resistant isolates were mainly clonal while high-level resistant isolates showed a high genetic diversity.

,Molecular basis of rifampin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae,ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY,"Rifampin resistance among South African clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae was shown to be due to missense mutations within the rpoB gene. Sequence analysis of 24 rifampin-resistant isolates revealed the presence of mutations within cluster I as well as novel mutations in an area designated pneumococcus cluster III. Of the 24 isolates characterized, only 1 resistant isolate did not contain any mutations in the regions sequenced. Either the cluster I or the cluster III mutations separately conferred MICs of 32 to 128 mu g/ml. Clinical isolate 55, for which the MIC was 256 mu g/ml, was noted to contain 9 of the 10 mutations identified, which included the cluster I and cluster III mutations. As in Escherichia coli, it is possible that cluster I (amino acids 406 to 434) and cluster III (amino acids 523 to 600) of S. pneumoniae interact to form part of the antibiotic binding site, thus accounting for the very high MIC observed for isolate 55.
