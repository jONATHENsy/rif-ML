Broad plan for project:

1. Use ASReview to find papers reporting RIF resistance mutations
	- Search term used: XXX
	- Papers found:
	- Relevant papers: 
2. Add data to our dataset of reported RIF resistance mutations
	2.1 Assess overlap: which papers do we already have?
	2.2 For some (or all) papers that we haven't covered already, add new data
3. Use unsupervised ML methods to identify clustering of mutations and species
4. Use supervised ML methods to predict what mutations should be observed in a species
