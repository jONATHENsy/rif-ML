Fixed board plan for project:

1. Use ASReview to find papers reporting RIF resistance mutations
	- Search term used: ((rifampicin OR rifampin) AND (resistance OR resistant) AND (mutation OR polymorphism OR variant))
	
	- Screening with ASReview:
			First round manual screen: 109 papers（46 relevant）
			
			First comparison (SciBERT vs SentenceBERT,threshold as 0.52):
			→ 1144 papers with differing labels
			→ Manually screened additional 113 papers（46 relevant)
			
			Second comparison(SciBERT vs SentenceBERT,threshold as 0.52): another 113 differing predictions
			→ Final manual screening on those 113(25 relevant）
			
			Total manually labelled relevant papers:
			→ First 109 + 113 from first diff + 113 from second diff =335 total---> take as final train set
	-Machine learning prediction to prioritize unlabeled papers
				Fine-tuned SciBERT used to classify papers
				Training data: All manually screened 335 papers
				→ 5-fold stratified cross-validation
				→ Find Best threshold (optimized): 0.174
				→ F1-score: 0.56, Recall: 0.75
				
				Prediction on full dataset:
				→ Applied model to remaining 3139 papers (excluding 335 labeled)
				
2. Add data to our dataset of reported RIF resistance mutations
	2.1 Assess overlap: which papers do we already have
	
		
	2.2 For some (or all) papers that we haven't covered already, add new data
3. Use unsupervised ML methods to identify clustering of mutations and species
4. Use supervised ML methods to predict what mutations should be observed in a species
