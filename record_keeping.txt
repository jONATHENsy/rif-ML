Week 24/3/2025
--------------

Meeting:

Week 09/06/2025
--------------

Meeting:
- looked at clustering figure (needs to be improved)
- looked at data: data for Salmonella all compensatory mutations that needed to be deleted
- talked about file structure for project: keep everything in one R project

To Dos:
- clean project structure, with single master R script that calls all other scripts
- make sure data is clean: all reference sequences present, mutations are all real mutations from mutant screens
- produce figures summarising the data (upset plot)
- clustering figures: try different methods (metrics, clustering algorithms)

Record keeping:
- 10/6/2025: did this or that


week 14/07/2025
Meeting：
-  talk about using confounder bias/ other methods to distinguish well studied species and others,
- discuss about basic heatmap and umap results ,find some doubtful species(could have a seq shift problem)
TO Dos：
- Searching methods to solve confounder bias problem
- Re-check google rif mutation docs' data for those doubtful species


week 05/08/2025
Meeting：
 - Discussed the issue of overcrowding of mutation names on the horizontal axis of the plot.
- Also discussed whether to modify or remove species with suspected incorrectly constructed mutation sites, such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus.
-Both professors suggested using self-made dummy data to test the feasibility of the clustering method.
week 12/08/2025
TO Dos：
- create dummydata sets for testing
-fix X-axis's scale problem and made plot available for zoomed out/in
-combine finding best clustering method and plot heatmap/umap together
- removed some doubtful species

week 12/08/2025
Meeting:
- looked high freq species/mid-high species' heatmaps and umaps
- talk about how to solve left margin problem
-Professor explain and discuss the aquirum vs ocean proble for "unknown" labels and "0"
 To Dos:
- fixing left margin on heatmaps plot, 
-finding the cut point to leave less studied muatation on the plot,
- read and understand professor's GPT discussion about supervised problems

Week 19/08/2025
Meeting:
- talk about repo structure improvement, especially the not proper with project plan's 4 step
- explain PU learning method used to treat unlabelled data and display some results
- discuss about "no trustful absence" problem , thats no proper test dataset available
TO Dos:
- fix structure problem in repo,try to display as 4 clear part
- read and learn more about PU-learning+ RF/Logical regression
- fix previous plot margin problem

Week 26/08/2025
Meeting:
- talk about supervised ML output figures,then explained used maskin method
- discuss about what kind of figure/graph examiers expect to see in the final report
TO Dos:
- make boxplot for masked vs unmasked mutations in selected species
- record and generate more figuresused for final report
- fix previous plot margin problem

Week 02/09/2025
Meeting:
- talk about future processes could be taken into this supervised ML
- discuss about why some exists mutation is shown in the prediction, then find out they are
not lab mutant type didn't be included in processed data.
TO Dos:
- Try to remove the same mutations in the prediction results as those in the 
Google file that are already included in the "non-laboratory mutants"
- start to record evaluations and conclusions for supervised ML results
- fix previous top30 unsupervised Ml plot margin problem

Week 09/09/2025
Meeting:
- talk about prediction result an method of removing non-lab mutant mutations.
- discuss about what kind of content need to be written into supervisedMl part in final paper
TO Dos:
- plot new figures for novel mutations' prediction(without natural isolated/construct)
- written description and analysis of unsupervised machine learning method and result

Week 18/09/2025
Meeting:
- talk about what kind of figures need to keep/select to display in final report/poster.
- explain the entire supervised Ml process and discuss about future improvement.
- professor helped to find some problem left in the above figures.
TO Dos:
- fix previous X-axis label problem in the candidate mutations plot
- improve boxplot for maskvsunmask in different species ,let them display in the same coordinate
- try to find other hidden problem in the exists supervised Ml part.

week 25/09/2025
meeting:
- talk about use shiny website to check predicted novel mutations existed or not
- try to analysis probability of predicted mutation base on codon transfer figure
- Discuss why Q148rR and H533L is predicted as high possible muttations
TO DOs:

- write analysis for results of unsupervised ML
- Try to understand clusters (N,1,2,3)'s meaning
- write conclusion for why above prediction could happen

Break since 27/09-07/10
Meeting: No, but keep contact with ALJE group members
Did:
- Fixed supervised ML last problem, deleted unnecessary figs
-Clean Rif-ML repository， move not mainstream scripts to 
- start the final report draft

Week 11 14/10/2025
Meeting:
- Discuss about upsetplot figs of unsupervisedml section in the paper draft
-delete plenty of figs for high confounder score species ,left only a few to compare with midhigh specues
-
To Dos:
- add gram positive-negative species compare on the last of unsupervised ml section
- make tables of supervisedml's out put talk about their top candidiates and mask vs unmasked recall difference
- Try finished result part of paper and booking a seminar time in the week 14

Week 12 21/10/2025
Meeting:
- Find main branch has mixed within a new main , this makes the repo very chaos
- Discuss about problems let in upsetplot of supervisedML part, may be delete the old version
- Learn and discuss about how to make multiple figs together as a fine good looking new one used in paper
- Received some suggestions for background breaking down, may focus on introducing ML methods and RIF mechanism

TO dos:
- Fixed repo structure problem , make only one main branch left in GitHub
- Try finish methods and results of paper draft
- Start prepare for Seminar and background of paper
