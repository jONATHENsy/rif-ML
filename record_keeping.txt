Week 24/3/2025
--------------

Meeting:
- talked about project plan
- refined search term for WoS
- talked about which papers are relevant (mutant screens) vs. not (clinical isolates)
- MEME: Fridays at 2pm in 08-501

To Dos:
- Make progress with ASReview


Week 09/06/2025
--------------

Meeting:
- looked at clustering figure (needs to be improved)
- looked at data: data for Salmonella all compensatory mutations that needed to be deleted
- talked about file structure for project: keep everything in one R project

To Dos:
- clean project structure, with single master R script that calls all other scripts
- make sure data is clean: all reference sequences present, mutations are all real mutations from mutant screens
- produce figures summarising the data (upset plot)
- clustering figures: try different methods (metrics, clustering algorithms)

Record keeping:
- 10/6/2025: did this or that


week 14/07/2025
Meeting：
-  talk about using confounder bias/ other methods to distinguish well studied species and others,
- discuss about basic heatmap and umap results ,find some doubtful species(could have a seq shift problem)
TO Dos：
- Searching methods to solve confounder bias problem
- Re-check google rif mutation docs' data for those doubtful species


week 05/08/2025
Meeting：
 - Discussed the issue of overcrowding of mutation names on the horizontal axis of the plot.
- Also discussed whether to modify or remove species with suspected incorrectly constructed mutation sites, such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus.
-Both professors suggested using self-made dummy data to test the feasibility of the clustering method.
week 12/08/2025
TO Dos：
- create dummydata sets for testing
-fix X-axis's scale problem and made plot available for zoomed out/in
-combine finding best clustering method and plot heatmap/umap together
- removed some doubtful species

week 12/08/2025
Meeting:
- looked high freq species/mid-high species' heatmaps and umaps
- talk about how to solve left margin problem
-Professor explain and discuss the aquirum vs ocean proble for "unknown" labels and "0"
 To Dos:
- fixing left margin on heatmaps plot, 
-finding the cut point to leave less studied muatation on the plot,
- read and understand professor's GPT discussion about supervised problems

Week 19/08/2025
Meeting:
- talk about repo structure improvement, especially the not proper with project plan's 4 step
- explain PU learning method used to treat unlabelled data and display some results
- discuss about "no trustful absence" problem , thats no proper test dataset available
TO Dos:
- fix structure problem in repo,try to display as 4 clear part
- read and learn more about PU-learning+ RF/Logical regression
- fix previous plot margin problem
